These programs use only the colors of the Pimoroni Pibow Zero case that was designed for the the Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.3.
Yes, you can run these programs on all versions of the Raspberry Pi. I just used the color scheme of the Pibow Zero 1.3 case for these programs.

# Demo
The demo program is a collection of 25 programs. It will randomly select one of the programs and run it for 15 seconds, then randomly choose another program.
