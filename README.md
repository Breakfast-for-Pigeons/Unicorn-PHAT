These are my programs for the Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT.

# American flag
Contains programs featuring the American flag

# Pibow Candy 
Contains programs using only the pastel colors of the Pibow Candy case. Choose which individual ones you like,  or get a taste of all of them with the pibow_candy_demo.py program.

# Pibow Zero 1.2
These programs will run on any version of the Raspberry Pi. They just feature only the colors of the case designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero 1.2 (the one without the camera port).

# Pibow Zero 1.3
These programs will run on any version of the Raspberry Pi. They just feature only the colors of the case designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero 1.3 (the one with the camera port).
