These programs use only the colors of the Pimoroni Pibow Zero case that was designed for the the Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.2.
Yes, you can run these programs on any version of the Raspberry Pi. I just used the color scheme of the original Pibow Zero case: Violet, Blue, Indigo, and White. White represents the clear layer of the case.

You can use the **./** before any of the files (except for bfp_unicornphat) to run the programs. For example:

` sudo ./pibow_zero_12_demo.py `

# Demo
The demo program is a collection of 54 programs. It will randomly select one of the programs and run it for 10 seconds. It will keep doing this until the user presses Ctrl-C.
