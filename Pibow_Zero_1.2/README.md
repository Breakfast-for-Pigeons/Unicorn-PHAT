These programs use only the colors of the Pimoroni Pibow Zero case that was designed for the the Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.2.
Yes, you can run these programs on the  Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.3. I just used the color scheme of the original Pibow Zero case for these programs.

# Weirdness
The vertial striping program, run by itself, works exactly the way I intended it to. I added it to the demo proram (which randomly selects different programs to run). I tested it in the demo program by making it the only program to run. Again, it runs exactly as expected. So I added all the other functions back to the demo program. If the vertial striping program gets selected very early on, it also runs fine. But when it gets selected after the program has been running for a while, the way it generates the stripes is weird (but cool). Haven't figured what's causing it.
